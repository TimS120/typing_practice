If a new file which shall be individual but is created, please add the file with minimal content into git, and then prevent any git update. This ensures that people can see the layout, i.e. how the file is built up, without creating big data which must be handeled and saved.
To do this:
1. Commit the file with minimal content
2. Prevent any update (locally): git update-index --skip-worktree path/to/file
